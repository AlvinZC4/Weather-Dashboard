Weather Dashboard

The Weather Dashboard application is an app that allows the user to search for a city by name and get the weather for that city.

The user will type the name of a city into the search bar and click on the search button and both the current weather and 5 day weather forecast for that city will be returned.  The information returned for the current weather includes an icon the repersents the current weather, the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and the UV index.  The background color of the UV index will vary depending on how high the retured IV index is.

The five day forecast for the city is also shown and includes an icon that repersents the predicted weather as well as the predicted temperature and humidity for each of the five days.

All searches that the user has made are saved on a search list on the left side of the screen.  The User may click on one of the previously searched cities to bring up the weather for that city.  The the list of saved cities is kept in local storage and will remain in place if the user leaves the applicaton and returns; also, the last city that had been searched will automatically have its weather forecast dispayed.  The "clear search history" button will remove the list of previously searched cities from the left panel of the screen as well as remove the list from local storage.
